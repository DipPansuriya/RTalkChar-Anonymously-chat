<h2>RTalkChat</h2>

<p>RTalkChat is a demo app that I made with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> as part of my internship at <a href="http://www.iflameinstitute.com//">Iflame</a>. Wouldn't have been possible without the guidance of my mentor, <strong>Mr Pallav.</strong></p>

<p>RTalkChat is very much a work in progress! There are several features I plan to add to make it more user-friendly.</p>
